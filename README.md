A web-based weather application in JavaScript. Implemented functionality to retrieve and display current weather conditions for various locations worldwide.

Used OpenWeather's API to retrieve weather data and customized it for integration in the web-application.

And also implemented a feature to enhance the user experience by adding a dynamic image generator. The system selects an image based on the city the user is searching for, providing a more visually engaging experience.
